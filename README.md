# DengAI-Predicting-Disease-Spread
Using environmental data from the cities San Juan and Iquitos to predict the number of cases of Dengue fever within a particular time span. As mosquitos thrive in warm and humid climates, countries with these characteristics should have higher cases of dengue fever. Increased amount of precipitation should also contribute to increase of mosquitos and thus cases of dengue fever. Provided with copious amounts of climate data and other factors, we will figure out the large contributors and predict the results of data provided later on.

## Pre-requisite:
	- Make sure you have anaconda installed.
	- install xgboost by running command: pip install xgboost

## To run:
	1. For Python Notebooks cd into folder and run command `jupyter notebook` and open files in browser
	2. For Python files run python filename.py

## Data:
	dataset csv and preprocessed csv are in 'data' folder
